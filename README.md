📚 Core Concepts
Break these down in your own words or with diagrams:
- ☁️Cloud Models: IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS - see below
-  🔽 SaaS
- ⚪Customer is responsible for:
-  Information and data
-  Devices(Mobile and PC's)
-  Accounts and identies
- ⚪Shared responsibilities:
-  Identity and directory infrastructure
- ⚪Microsoft's responsibilities:
-  Applicationa
-  Network controls
-  Operating system
-  Physical hosts
-  Physical network
-  Physical datacenter
- 🔽PaaS
- ⚪Customer is responsible for:
-  Information and data
-  Devices(Mobile and PC's)
-  Accounts and identies
- ⚪Shared responsiblities:
-  Identity and directory infrastructure
-  Applicationa
-  Network controls
- ⚪Microsoft's responsibilities:
-  Operating system
-  Physical hosts
-  Physical network
-  Physical datacenter
-  🔽IaaS
- ⚪Custoner responsibilities

- Types of Cloud: Public, Private, Hybrid:
- 🔽Private cloud
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security
- Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data
- Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates
- 🔽Public cloud
- No capital expenditures to scale up
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
- Organizations pay only for what they use
- Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security
- 🔽Hybrid cloud
- Provides the most flexibility
- Organizations determine where to run their applications
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements
